            Hi there! I'm Jacob or Jt, whichever is easier. I enjoy playing chess, reading, and programming! I do the best I can in everything, and I refute the inability to learn change and grow. This class is really cool!

          <h2>My Personal Chess Theorem</h2>
          <p>So, I have played the game of kings since I was young. I always found joy and passion within the game, and the recent explosion of the game has
            given me much to think on the matter. I'm not the best by any means, but I still sit comfortably in the 80th percentile when playing online. So first off,
            what is my chess theory? Well it derives from many years of honing a variety of crafts. From the physical to the mental, most of my life I have adopted a sage
            typical lifestyle. I rarely interact, I enjoy peace and quiet to degrees some may find odd but I find solace in thought. And my theorem dictates:
            Loss is inevitable. No matter what. So why, worry about an outcome? Why place such high regard to a grade or a win? Why not.. Play to learn? Not play to win.
            Of course winning is a natural desire, but cutting off that feeling makes everything much smoother. I remember I read awhile back that a loss will always,
            no matter the circumstances, hurt twice as much as the enjoyment derived from victory. If you take the outcome as nothing more than a number or letter, what are you really loosing?
            Did you do your best? Did you find fun in the activity? Did you learn? These questions are much more pressing and important than the actual outcome. 
            If you spend time worrying about the inevitable; "Eventually you'll lose", "Eventually you'll be worse", "Eventually you'll miss something" then what is the point?
            Similar to life, chess is not about the outcome, half the time it's not about the battle. It's about growth. It's about connection to others and self improvement (this is why it's a personal theorem)
            I can lead a horse to water, but you must be the one to drink. Even if someone does not find joy in chess, it could simply be there un-movable perspective. I
            believe this is why the youth have flocked towards the game. They're flexible, and they want to make the most out of an activity. "Chess is boring?" Only if you want 
            it that way. 
            
            This leads to the second half of my theorem. Even if you can't escape the thought of outcome, try this. What was the emotional outcome? 
            "Did I make that move out of frustration?", "Did I allow this feeling to control me?", "And if so, why?". Was there a truly tangible reason for
            these feelings? Stopping to think before you speak is such a common trope, but there is so much merit to the statement. Often times many forget the
            greatest piece of wisdom; Words are powerful. 
            
            Overall, this was all written to avoid directly placing my personal bias into my exam paper. I'd consider myself well studied in philosophy and many of the
            ideas are a matter of my favorite mantra; It all comes down to perspective. I also wanted to blab about chess philosophy but, my merits can be unseen at a glance so
            I decided to place it all here. Academic writing on such a wide topic was by no means easy, but I relished the challenge.
